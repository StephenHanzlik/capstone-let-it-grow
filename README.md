# Galvanize Classified - Part 2

## Read the entire README before beginning. Commit often.

## Project Description

This is a simple Angular front end for your Galvanize Classified API.  **Part 3 will involve styling, so keep it as simple as possible.  We want to evaluate the Angular skills outside of styling.**

### Getting Started

Copy your files from **Part 1** into your project directory.  This is important: make sure you don't edit the part 1 files so we can evaluate each part independently.   This also allows you to redo pieces of this assessment individually.

### Requirements

You are responsible for:

- [ ] Forking and cloning this GitHub Repo.
- [ ] Creating a simple Angular front end.
- [ ] Deployment of the App on Heroku.

### Functionality

The app should do the following:

- Display all of the ads
- Post a new ad
- Edit existing ads
- Delete an ad
- Filter ads (titles and descriptions)
- Sort ads based on posting date and price
