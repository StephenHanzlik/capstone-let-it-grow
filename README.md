## About

Let It Grow is an open sourced browser based project that allows users to pull data from indoor and outdoor gardens. It was inspired by the concept of the vertical farm, food production in vertically aligned rows, such as a sky scraper, and is intended to make accessing facility data easier. An Arduino Uno, combined with a powerful weather shield from Spark Fun and WIFI capabilities by Electric Imp, sends HTTP post requests to the server every 3 seconds.  Live graphs and gauges give users insight into current grow conditions and foster decisive, informed decisions.  This project exemplifies the power of the modern browser and it's ability to render a single page app powered by JSON data. Let it grow, let it grow, greatly yield!

## Journey of Data

The data starts by being gathered by the sensors connected to the Arduino.   The reading is set equal to a variable and
